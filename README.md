# Play against a python ai
The ai is very very easy. The `playagainstai.py` file lets you play as black and the `playagainstaiaswhite.py` file lets you play as white.
# How to run
- You may need to install the modules
- Do them by: ``
pip install chess
pip install time
pip install random
``
- You obviously need python :D
# Have fun!
